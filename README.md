# Tailwind Practice Project

This project is for learning and practicing Tailwind CSS by creating a simple landing page.

## Overview

The goal is to recreate a nice looking landing page design using Tailwind utility classes. It will not use any custom CSS.

The page will demonstrate common Tailwind components like:

- Navigation menu
- Hero sections
- Buttons
- Responsive design

It allows getting familiar with Tailwind class names and how to construct UIs without writing CSS.
